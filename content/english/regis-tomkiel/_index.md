### Who am I?
I'm a Brazilian software developer, born in a country town called [Alpestre](https://www.alpestre.rs.gov.br/ and living in Caxias do Sul.  
I started my professional life working with IT support, changing computer parts, installing Windows, and managing servers.  
Soon after, I worked as a ***freelancer*** after I created, and managed a web agency, and even managed a heavy metal band.

### What do I do?
I'm [Full Stack](https://www.linkedin.com/in/regis-tomkiel) web developer at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/). I love learning new technologies, creating content, and learning from people.    
My domain languages and technologies:
 - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
 - [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
 - [Java](https://www.java.com/pt_BR/)
 - [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
 - [React](https://reactjs.org/)
 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
 - [HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/html/)
 - [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/)
 - ...

I recently started a web framework project in Python using MVC architecture, inspired by the PHP Framework [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). You can learn more about the project by going to my [GitHub](https://github.com/getfalafel).

### What moves me?
I am a strict vegetarian, atheist, Free Software, and animal rights enthusiast.
Since I stopped eating animals, I was able to experience a different view of the world. Not always comfortable, despite human cruelty, the universe is captivating and beautiful.
I don't believe in creative entities, all I see is the beauty of chance, natural laws. Life always finds a way to fill the voids.

I'm a [Star Trek](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek) fan and I refuse to believe that the future promised in the stories, with inequality ending, is a dream.
Star Trek offers us a world without money, animal abuse, and inequality. These are things worth dreaming about.

As a child, I wanted to be a historian or a cosmonaut, because I loved discovery, stories, and the constant quest to understand the past and future. As you can see, I didn't become either of them. I chose to try to change the world with technology.   

My life goal is to fight against inequality and animal abuse!

> The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.
