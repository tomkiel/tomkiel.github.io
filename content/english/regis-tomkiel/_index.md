### Who Am I?  

I am a Software Engineer with over 8 years of experience in web development. I have extensive knowledge of languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, and PHP, as well as hands-on experience with modern frameworks like React, Angular, Spring Boot, Flask, and Laravel. Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at Thoughtworks, contributing to high-impact projects such as developing e-commerce platforms using micro-frontend architecture and scalable CMS solutions for global companies.  

I have experience leading teams as a Tech Lead and managing stakeholders in complex projects. I thrive in multi-technology environments, working with tools like AWS, Docker, Jenkins, and PostgreSQL, as well as testing frameworks like Vitest. In one of my most challenging projects, I worked on data processing with machine learning to enhance customer experience and decision-making processes.  

I am also the co-founder of **FOSSDay**, an initiative that promotes the use of open-source software. Additionally, I have led the development of tailored solutions for startups and mid-sized companies. I am passionate about collaborating with the tech community, participating in events and organizations like Tchelinux.  

I hold a degree in Information Systems from the University of Caxias do Sul and have advanced proficiency in English. I also create technical content to share knowledge through my website, **tomkiel.com.br**, and my YouTube channel, **TomkielTV**.  

> Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.
