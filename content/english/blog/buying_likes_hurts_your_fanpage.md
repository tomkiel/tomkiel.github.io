> It is what everyone wants when creating a page on facebook, whether for personal, fun u brand representation on social media. One has a wrong perception that what matters is the numbers and not what they mean. as it was in the past with “[*Internet button*](https:https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolha_da_Internet)”, these non-organic strategies can mean the failure of many companies. n It is important to warn that it is not a personal opinion isolated u pure achismo. it is very easy to identify the flaws of this system by simply accessing the page and checking the latest posts. through embedded reports, generated on the platform itself, we can further strengthen the argument. 

### The operation of Facebook


> The **Facebook** is the world's most hated social network, with more than **1 billion** of active oraries, being **99 million** only in brasil. these numbers mean that there are many potential customers and new opportunities for a brand. However, behind the site there are numerous algorithms that will influence the number of views of your content, regardless of the number of total likes. that is well explained in social network policies. -When a certain content is posted, it is believed that only 1 to 10 of the fans will be organically hit. the remainder, for numerous reasons, will not even know that the page is still active. Of course this says a lot about the quality of what is shared and the way the brand **talk** with its followers. The subject is so broad, that it is better to write a post dedicated to the subject.

### Many likes don't mean good engagement

Another big disadvantage in **buy likes**, is in fanpage performance over time. engagement is compromised, since from this strategy, a segmented and unbearable audience is acquired. As long as a certain group of interests is promised, it is not possible to have such control. *
the result of this is a low reach of publications u worse, if we think about the empathy of the public and the brand. this fan base does not necessarily have identification with the posted content, which can generate negative feedback such as concealment of consecutive spam reports. that would be enough to play any campaign for scan.  

### And the alternative not to buy likes?

First it is important to know that a solid fan base is not built from night to day. It is the result of a  [structural work](http://blog.doseextra.com/revista/digital-focused-in-results/) intense and company positioning in the middle. it is possible to increase engagement with a page with frequent updates, quality content, creative calls and a lot, but much strategic planning.  

This does not mean that millions of likes are of no importance. If they are the result of a good work in **Social media**, they will certainly have much more value and will bear fruit beyond expectation. Yeah.

**Engaged factors generate results!**
