###  Another tchelinux arriving
It is with great joy that [Dose Extra](//doseextra.com "Dose Extra Multimídia"), one of Tchelinux's supporters, invites the general public to another event in Capital Gaúcha.   

The event takes place on December 9 at the Faculty of Porto Alegre, scheduled for Senac at 08:30h. In addition to my talk, which is about **Video Production and Editing on Linux**, there are 29 other talks on very varied topics and for different audience profiles. I am unaware of the event as broad as this one, with professionals from renowned companies and startups that were born this year. Everything was very well organized and distributed in six rooms.   

***Dose Extra*** is supporting with social media and publicizing the event, creating material and content for social networks. In addition, of course, to support with equipment and labor on the day of the event. We do this because we believe in the power of [Free Software](http://softwarelivre.org/) and in the culture of sharing knowledge and experiences.
