**How to sell your car as a visual effects professional**


When we think about selling something used, newspaper ads and more recently Facebook groups come to mind. Between us, few would bother to produce a video for their used car, right? Even more, for a car manufactured in 1996.


Well, not everyone, but the Latvian Eugene Romanovsky decided to make an epic video, with special effects, extravagant scenarios, scripting, and much more, worthy of being compared to the commercials of millionaire brands. The result is sensational, humorous and with very interesting production insights.


Watch the video and see the creativity of a VFX professional with a lot of good humor, free time and a great desire to sell his used car.

What we can observe as producers is a good mix between the epic sound, which is responsible for the tone of the film, visual effects, scene composition that follows the same line of sound and a rhythmic montage, which closes with a key of gold. Certainly the best ad for a Suzuki Vitara 96 â€‹â€‹you will ever see. ![ðŸ™‚](https://sworg/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png)
