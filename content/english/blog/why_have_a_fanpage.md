#### Why have a fanpage?


Did you know that users can also report your business, claiming that your profile represents a brand and not an individual?


The [Facebook](//facebook.com/doseextra "Facebook") makes clear in their [terms of service](https://www.facebook.com/help/1735443093393986 ?helpref=hc_global_nav) that each individual can have a unique profile and that it must be of a personal nature. This means that any company profile is in breach of the terms of service and therefore can be removed at any time.

It's certainly not cool for your company to work on gaining a solid and engaged base of followers, to lose everything all of a sudden. A fact like this can be enough for an even greater failure, after all, we are talking about a company's reputation. Not to mention that most of the time, besides the profile, there is no care with the image on social media.


If you read the [user policy](https://www.facebook.com/help/1735443093393986?helpref=hc_global_nav) and the legal terms available on Facebook, you will see that the Network profiles are individual, and each person must have ***only one profile***. In addition, you will also see that any company should create a Fanpage, taking advantage of all the advantages, such as detailed reports and boosting tools. After all, that's what it exists and was reserved for.

It is with strict policies that the platform is staying relevant in the market, attracting more consumers and generating business. A well-managed page should result in engagement, more sales and market relevance. And in many cases, these results are better than traditional print media. To ignore this is to turn your back on future customers and partners.


The best way to get good results is to start by reading the social network policies and follow tips from blogs [like this one](//blog.doseextra.com) ![ðŸ˜Ž]( https://sworg/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f60e.png) To do so, do not miss any publication of the series on [Social Media](//blog.doseextra.com/categories/digital-media/).
