Until the late 2000s, virtually every website was designed exclusively for a fixed *desktop*resolution, chosen by the *designer* and then applied to programming. It was an inflexible process, which most of the time results in ‚Äúlittle monsters‚Äù if the site was accessed at a different resolution than had been thought of. It turns out that, in the early 2000s, there was the advent of LCD screens and, as a result, several resolutions were present in homes, in addition to the fact that computers are increasingly powerful, we had totally unconfigured websites and frustrating experiences.


Now, imagine this scenario with at least 20 models of popular *smartphones*, tablets, notebooks, *smart TVs*and any other type of device for internet access. A poorly programmed website will not work, it will look weird and most likely, it will generate a very negative image about the company or person behind the project. There's no escaping the *responsiveness.*


**See some examples:**n

**But what is responsiveness?**


It basically means that the site will work on all screens, regardless of size. If we want to be more precise, it means that work was carried out with modern technologies that provide this. These are programming and design practices, which are generally linked to what we call ‚Äúgood conduct‚Äù, that is, a website prepared for ranking in search engines, use over mobile networks (3G or 4G) and that work well when shared on social networks. A good example is [Extra Dose Blog](//blog.doseextra.com), share this post on Facebook and see how well it behaves. ![üòâ](https://sworg/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png)


**Okay, but where do I start?**


You can start by consulting other articles within the [Blog](//blog.doseextra.com), as we will be posting related content. Or read material from [w3schools](//www.w3schools.com), the largest site with content for web development.


Some important tips for now, is that there are some *frameworks* that help a lot, like [Materialize](//materializecss.com/) and [Bootstrap](//getbootstrap.com/). They provide libraries (files) ready to be used in projects, in addition to having a huge community and extensive documentation.


Now that you know a little more about the topic, be sure to follow the next articles by liking our page on [Facebook](//facebook.com/doseextra), also, leave it in the comments your questions or suggestions for posts.
