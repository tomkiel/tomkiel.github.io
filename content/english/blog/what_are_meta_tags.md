###  Site information


A site basically has two types of information when accessed in the browser. the first group, it is the first legible content for people, that is, all visible on the page. some examples may be:


< >
- 

/* < >
* [Text of an article](# "How")

/

	/
		- < >
		- < a title= " Setting a featured image in a post" href="#"> Featured image

		/

			/
				+ < >
				+ [Share links](# "Make sharing your content")

				/

					/
						* < >
						* [Author information](# "Tell")

						/

							/
								- < >
								- < a title= " Using adsense in the correct form" href="#">Publicity

										> What are a site meta tags?
										Well, we have seen that a site is not just articles and images. There's no point in a well-written article if no one reads, right? so that your articles reach more people, some information that tells the seekers what they really have on the site is necessary. the goal is to facilitate indexing your content. *
										the seekers are getting much smarter and taking into consideration, especially the quality of the content. some *tags* as the *keywords*, which consists of adding keywords related to the text, are now irrelevant to google. in its place, if we can talk like this, the occurrence of words in the text is analyzed. *
										if some *tags* are becoming obsolete, others remain very important, such as the *meta tag* *title* u a *description*. as logically noted, they have the title information of a page, as well as its description, respectively. other *meta tags* important, are the **open graph** of facebook, which ensure better integration with the social network and what will be shared.n **An example of open graph meta tags:**  

										`...`


										`...`


										* This is an example of the oo of the **open graph** tags. Let's see what some mean:


										it ensures that when sharing the post on the facebook, this will be exactly the title of sharing and not just “Extra Blog Dose”. people interested in *Meta Tags* would never know what the text is about.




										says it’s a site post and not a static page, like “About”, for example. >


										as well as *og:title*, force the facebook to use this description of the content. >


										in case of redirection, this tag helps to say what the real url of the content is. >
										* Not always the image defined as the featured image will appear on the facebook, to solve this, we can use the tag *og:image* and tell you what image we want to pray on the share. *
										n***Only be attentive to the format and dimensions requirements of Facebook***.




										here we say who is the author of the post, being able to profile u page. >


										we say the location of our content, helping facebook filter who may be interested in content. >
										 Other options of **tags** can be verified in the [documentation officer](http://ogp.me/ " Documentation open graph").


										> Common meta tags
										* The most common meta tags can be verified in the following example:


										`...`







										`...`


										#### 

										we define the location of our content, as *pt\_BR* for a Portuguese speaker of brasil and *pt\_PT* for Portugal. >

										the page title, as explained in the *open graph*. >
										* The description of the content of the post in a reduced and objective way.

										* It can be used to inform the author's name, but it is not relevant and used.

										in the contact email for sending messages. never claws and is little used.

										here are the *keywords*, which are a few words pertaining to the content. lost almost all importance in searches.

										Information about the generator u cms of the site. in case of cms with database and dinamic content, it is not legal to expose the information, since it can be used in cases of invasion attempts. as in our case, it is a static site, naturally safer, and we are publishing the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/ " Meet the hugo"). 🙂
										This is where we define the *ícone* of the site.
										> Final considerations
										* I hope that the article has been useful and that web standards are increasingly demystified. you can study more by following our posts u by following the following links:
