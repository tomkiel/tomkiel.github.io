In today's video we will learn how to install [EasyEngine](https://easyengine.io/ "EasyEngine Website"), a set of scripts that automate server maintenance WEB.  

It is recommended for hosting [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org/ "WordPress website") with caching technology, web server [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/ "nginx website "), database [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/ "MariaDB Website") and operating system [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/ "Ubuntu Website") 16.04 [GNU/Linux](https:/ /www.gnu.org/ "GNU Website"). It is possible to greatly facilitate the maintenance of servers, in addition to ensuring security, performance and low investment. Being able to start with a server [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/f00102c3bd64 "Earn a few dollars at Digital Ocean") from $S5.00.< br />
In the tutorial, docker was used as “***virtualizer***”, only with the ease of management that is offered with the containners. In a production environment, I strongly recommend using a VPS without docker, as it is still in the implementation phase.
