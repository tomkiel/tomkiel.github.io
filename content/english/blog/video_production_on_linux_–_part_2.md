In the last article we discovered that it is possible to work with [Video Production On Linux](http://zine.doseextra.com/revista/producao-de-videos-no-linux-parte-1/) and today we are going to talk about the desktop, minimum settings and installing some software. First of all, it is worth mentioning that we are going to elaborate a scenario of desktops of common use and not of high-performance *workstations*, that is, these articles are designed for those who are just starting out.


To start producing on Linux, first (and obviously) you need to install a *distribution* on your computer. Today this process is very simple, especially if the choice is Ubuntu. Just download the file, preferably amd64, burn it to a flash drive using the tutorial from the Diolinux website, restart your computer and follow the installation procedures.


The process is quite simple, as you can see in the **video** below:n

With the **Operating System** configured, we will install the first editing software, which in the case of this article will be *Kdenlive* and *Natron*, both open source and free.nTo install *Kdenlive* there are several alternatives, but we are going to use the of the *snaps* packages, which is a very simplified new way to install programs on Linux.nFirst, in the application menu type “***Terminal***” and click on the icon that will appear:

Terminal on linux


In the *Terminal*, paste the following command and press the *Enter* key:  

**” sudo snap install –edge –force-dangerous –devmode kdenlive-dev**![Installing Kdenlive on Linux](//i.imgur.com/wiwkLn5.png)  

Installing Kdenlive


Once installed, the program will appear in the list of installed programs:![Kdenlive already installed on Linux ](//i.imgur.com/3ySxD76.png)Running the program


The **Natron** is a little different, as there are still no *snaps* packages available, not that this prevents us from installing and using this non-linear editing software in a full. To install, just go to the following [site](http://packages.deepin.com/deepin/pool/main/n/natron/), download the version corresponding to your Linux(amd64) and double click on the program.  



You will be prompted for your computer password at installation time, just enter and press the *Enter key.* ![Password for installing Natron on Linux](//i.imgur.com/SxCGGfK.png)Enter your password to confirm the installationnWith the programs installed, it's time to get to work and discover all the features of these tools for *filmmakers*, but that's a topic for the next article, no miss.
